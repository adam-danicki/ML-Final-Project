---INSTRUCTIONS---

Installs
- To run the experiments install the Python libraries
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn

Random Forests  (Adam)
- Run the script containing the Random Forests implementation 'random_forest.py'
- To change datasets, update the source parameter in load_data()
    - './Data/rice.csv'
    - './Data/parkinsons.csv'
    - './Data/credit.csv'
    - 'digits' (from scikit-learn)
- The experiments section has two key hyperparameters which can be changed
    - ntree_vals
    - min_size
- Output contains two things
    - a table printed in the console including comparing ntree, accuracy, and F1 score
    - a plot of Accuracy and F1 score vs the number of trees

KNN (Adam)
- Run the script containing the KNN implementation 'knn_algorithm.py'
- To change datasets, update the source parameter in load_data()
    - './Data/rice.csv'
    - './Data/parkinsons.csv'
    - './Data/credit.csv'
    - 'digits' (from scikit-learn)
- The experiments section has one key hyperparameter which can be changed
    - k_vals
- Output contains two things
    - a table printed in the console comparing k, accuracy, and F1 score
    - a plot of Accuracy and F1 score vs the number of neighbors
