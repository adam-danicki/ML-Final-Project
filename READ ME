---INSTRUCTIONS---

Installs
- To run the experiments install the Python libraries
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn

Random Forests  (Adam)
- Run the script containing the Random Forests implementation 'random_forest.py'
- To change datasets, update the source parameter in load_data()
    - './Data/rice.csv'
    - './Data/parkinsons.csv'
    - './Data/credit.csv'
    - 'digits' (from scikit-learn)
- The experiments section has two key hyperparameters which can be changed
    - ntree_vals
    - min_size
- Output contains two things
    - a table printed in the console including comparing ntree, accuracy, and F1 score
    - a plot of Accuracy and F1 score vs the number of trees

KNN (Adam)
- Run the script containing the KNN implementation 'knn_algorithm.py'
- To change datasets, update the source parameter in load_data()
    - './Data/rice.csv'
    - './Data/parkinsons.csv'
    - './Data/credit.csv'
    - 'digits' (from scikit-learn)
- The experiments section has one key hyperparameter which can be changed
    - k_vals
- Output contains two things
    - a table printed in the console comparing k, accuracy, and F1 score
    - a plot of Accuracy and F1 score vs the number of neighbors



KNN & Neural Nets(Sahil) -> Performed on all datasets except Digits
-With the libraries above installed into your environment, all you have to do is run each labeled cell in whichever 
 algorithm you want to run, though be sure to go top down to correctly load in all data, packages and initialize all functions.
 Note that the outputs already present in the notebook may differ from the outputs you see in the report, since I did a sanity 
 run to make sure everything actually runs, hence the different outputs.
